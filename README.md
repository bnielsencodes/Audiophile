### What I learned

This was my first time using the Nextjs framework. Due to the extensive documentation, it wasn't very difficult to do whatever I needed to. The Image and Link components that Next provides are both very helpful. Also, having to not have to take care of routing code was great.

This was also my first time using Formik and Yup. Formik is great because it saves you a lot of time and writing code, but there are some learning curves and unfortunately there is not a ton of great documentation or support online. The tutorial Formik provides on their website is very helpful, but there are still a lot of things that it does not explain. So it wasn't easy to accomplish some of the things I wanted to do, but overall, I am happy with what I was able to accomplish with Formik.

CSS modules was another first for me on this project. I find it very helpful to have the styles localized the way they are in css modules, but I did miss the nesting when utilizing Sass.

### Continued development

Some things I plan on implementing into this project in the near future:

- Remove the "e-Money" payment option and replace it with credit/debit card payment option, add new inputs for card information.
- Improve accessibility
- Implement localStorage for cart
